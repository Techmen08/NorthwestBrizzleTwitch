		<h2>Updates to page </h2>
		<p>
			For V4 I added a trasition on the Twitch Crew picture. I added a trailer for an upcoming game.
			I used a Zelda sound bite as my audio. I also added a Suggestion box.
		</p>
		<p>
			For V3 I added a flex box to make everything in the about me in 3 columns.
			I also added more pictures. I attempted to make it usable on a phone but
			couldn't get the nav bar to work. Last i added a schedule for the times i am streaming.
		</p>
		<p>
			For V2 I added everything that was required from V1. I added backgrounds and put the oversized picture on index.html in a figure and framed it. 
			I added a picture in the header and moved the nav bar to horizontal. The about me link that was broken is now a working page. I added a picture link on this page. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For V1 I added my logo that is way too big. I changed the background to green and the header to black.
			I added links to the main page for the class plus one that I am currently working on. I added a top of the page link under the logo. 
			I also added a link to my Twitch in the paragaph. The list of games are an ordered list.
