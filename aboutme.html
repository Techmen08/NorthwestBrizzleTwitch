	<h1> About Me</h1>
		<p>
			I am a Navy veteran that grew up in Portland, Oregon. I joined the Navy right out of high school and was enlisted for 10 years. 
			I saw the world and had some good and bad times along the way. In my last year in the Navy I contracted a rare nerve disease called 
			Complex regional pain syndrome or CRPS. I was unable to walk without assistance. I got back into gaming because it is really all I could do.
			I met up with an old friend that told me about streaming on Twitch. I looked into and figured I would give it a shot. I have been an Affiliate
			with Twitch for almost a year. It was hard work but it was fun. I have made a lot of friends along the way.
